Welcome to the Translation team.

You're gonna learn how to submit the translation to us via this file. It's a lots of steps but it's the best process to be super efficient in the future.

STEP 1 : Get HUGO

We're using the Hugo templating system, https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/ instructions to install HUGO and create a PATH

STEP 2 : GitHub and GIT

Create an account on Git hub and download the GitHub Desktop
Then go to https://git-scm.com/ and download and install GIT

Step 3 : Repositary from GitHub

We need to clone the repo of the website to our computer. The best way is to follow those two things :

How to clone : https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository
Dogecoin foundation git hub repo : https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/foundation.dogecoin.com
Then move the foundation.dogecoin.com folder into c:/Hugo/Sites (easier like that)

Step 4 : Make sure it's installed and ready 

Open command prompt and type those line one after each other

C:\ cd \

C:\>cd Hugo

C:\Hugo>cd Sites

C:\Hugo\Sites>cd foundation.dogecoin.com

C:\Hugo\Sites\foundation.dogecoin.com>hugo serve -D

Notice how it says 'Webserver is now available on http://localhost:1313/'
If you pop that into your web-browser, you should be seeing the website but running locally from your laptop.

If you don't see it or nothing is showing, you might have miss one of the step.

You are ready to translate :)

Step 5 : Translation 

In the content folder (inside c:/Hugo/sites/foundation.dogecoin.com) you have all the pages and articles.
You can duplicate the files in .md and rename the new one with your iso lamguage code
Follow the same format (french for example its "about.fr.md")

Translate and keep the same HTML format in the file.

Save the files in the folder.

Step 6 : Submit your translation on Git Hub

Open GitHub Desktop and add the repo from c:/Hugo/sites/foundation.dogecoin.com
You should see on the left the changes you made (the new files you have created in your language)

Then on the top you have "current branch" add a new one and name it something like translation_YOURLANGUAGE

Bottom left you have description and title, explain what you did there quickly then click commit to.

Finally create a pull request to send everything to git hub pending review from the team.
