It is with great excitement that today we are able to announce the re-establishment of the **Dogecoin Foundation** *(est 2014),* with a renewed focus on supporting the Dogecoin Ecosystem, Community and promoting the future of the Dogecoin Blockchain. 

### Focus

The Dogecoin Foundation is not here to 'take control' of the *Dogecoin Core Wallet* project, which remains the primary reference implementation of a compliant Dogecoin Wallet.  We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project. 

The Dogecoin Foundation is also looking to the future of the broader Dogecoin ecosystem, and in coming weeks will be announcing new projects that will compliment the current Core Wallet to enable faster integration and easier APIs for Financial, Social and Charitable projects wishing to use Dogecoin. We believe that the success of Dogecoin is through broad global adoption and utility, and intend to focus on projects that increase Dogecoin uptake at a grass-roots level.

### Protecting the Dogecoin Brand

For many years the Dogecoin community has continued to think the best of people and hoped that everyone could play nicely with the name and logos,  Dogecoin belongs to the people after all. 

However in recent times the Dogecoin name and imagery has been under attack by numerous companies and individuals who have attempted to trademark the 'Dogecoin' brand under various jurisdictions. 

Not many people know this, but we would like to commend one Very Good Shibe: Jens Wiechers, who since 2014 has single-handedly and at great personal expense fought these kinds of attacks through the trademark office under the banner of the Dogecoin Foundation to protect everyone's right to use the Dogecoin brand. (really, do let them know you appreciate it if you see them)

The Foundation holds the Dogecoin mark and the Dogecoin Logo and will maintain them for the community. This will mean the Foundation can continue to protect the Dogecoin Brand, and allow (under a very liberal license) the ability to use it for Dogecoin related memes, projects and fun. — We've got your back on this one.  


### The Dogecoin Manifesto

We have been thinking about what Dogecoin means: as a technical project and as a movement for good in the world. We've condensed it down into four statements that we are calling the Dogecoin Manifeso, two are technical focused and two are social. 

We believe that together these key pillars that embody 'do only good, every day', will guide us forward as we make decisions and advance the Dogecoin ecosystem.

If you can, please 'sign' the Manifesto by clicking the tweet link at the bottom of the Manifesto page, lets let the world know what the doge army stands for! 

### Stop, collaborate and listen!

One of the key tenants of the Manifesto is that we value _collaboration and trust_ over _competition and exclusivity_. With that in mind we have established a small but intensely smart and amazing group of Advisors with experience in a range of areas who will be allies and advocates for Dogecoin as we seek to grow and develop the ecosystem. 

[Head on over and check out our amaze Advisors list](/about), and be sure to give them some love for offering their valuable time.

### The cost of success

The Foundation re-launches with the help of many volunteers who have been working tirelessly over the past several months. We recognise however that Dogecoin (at time of writing a 44 billion dollar financial product) has grown in size beyond many organisations with thousands of employees. 

It has come to the point that many of the people who have been working non-stop to make Dogecoin what it is today whilst holding down full-time day jobs have been burning out and struggling to deal with the flood of attention (good and bad) that Dogecoin has been receiving. 

This comes at a cost, talented new people come to the project hoping to help and there is no one to welcome them or help them find a place and so they leave frustrated. The documentation effort has stalled, potential patches sit un-reviewed while the limited time a small core of people have is focused on critical issues.

### Sponsorship

We believe Dogecoin deserves the attention of a team of full-time contributors who can help carry the burden of these more mundane tasks that keep the Dogecoin project alive. 

The Foundation has been preparing a budget and has received some expressions of interest from a number of people who are able to contribute. We aim to build a group of annual sponsors who can cover Foundation activities and a modest development team. 

Our Initial target is to secure a three year budget so that we can on-board a minimum staff to improve Dogecoin full time, without having to worry about job security.

If you are in a position to support the Dogecoin Foundation through major sponsorship please reach out, we'd love to speak with you.

Much love,  — The Dogecoin Foundation
