Focus The Dogecoin Foundation is not here to ‘take control’ of the Dogecoin Core Wallet project, which remains the primary reference implementation of a compliant Dogecoin Wallet. We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Roadmap</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/roadmap/</guid><description>Watch this space, technical &amp;amp; project roadmap for the Foundation is being drafted and will be announced shortly.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/about/</guid><description>The Dogecoin Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation established to provide:

Being welcoming, we value collaboration and trust over competition and exclusivity. Being reliable, we value working solutions over speed of delivery.</description></item></channel></rss>
